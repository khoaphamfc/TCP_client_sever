The purpose of this project is to communicate between client and server using TCP. In particular, the client will send only the TCP sequence numbers to the server. On reception of the sequence numbers, the server will respond to the client with the corresponding “ACK numbers”. On receiving an ACK, the client will adjust the sliding window. The server, on the other hand, will continue receiving the sequence numbers and keep track of any missing sequence number. 
If there is no missing sequence number, the server will consider all the packets till that sequence number are received. Now, while sending the packets (represented by sequence numbers), the client probabilistically drop 1% of the packets. Server will keep track of the missing packets. After a specific time, the client will retransmit the dropped packets with the same probability.
